# DBSLFP_preprocessing

This is the repository for DBS-LFP data preprocessing pipeline. This pipeline effectively imports and filters all raw data from different days and removes different forms of artifacts. Furthermore, it can be used to segment the data by events (symptom episodes) and aggregate the data from different days by channel. To start, run the main preprocessing script. Once cloned, do not change the directory structure to aviod unexpected bugs. All raw datasets should be stored in a single folder (non-hierarchical).
